Dear DXC Technology Team,

I am currently studying at Hong Kong Baptist University, majoring in Business Computing & Data Analytics, from which I will be graduating in May 2026. It is with great interest that I am applying for the Java Intern position at DXC Technology.

I am confident that my technical qualifications and work experiences developing solutions for clients and end users make me an excellent candidate for this internship. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I can help support DXC Technology's needs.

Thank you for your consideration.
Attached you will find my CV and recommendation letters.

Yours sincerely,
Juan Felix Pangestu
